# 0x14. JavaScript - Web scraping

## Introduction

Web scraping is the process of gathering information from the Internet.
It is common practice for companies to use web scraping to gain a competitive advantage.
For example, a company may scrape a competitor's website to collect product prices
and use that information to adjust their own prices accordingly.
Web scraping is also used for things like research, price monitoring, and machine learning.

The tasks in this project are focused on web scraping using JavaScript.
All the code follows the Semistandard style.
